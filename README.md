sentimentclassify
=================
This is a course project of Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovey
.<br/>
<br/>
We are using SVM and Perceptron to train and classify the sentiment datasets.<br/>
<br/>
We are using the java version of liblinear ,which can be found at http://liblinear.bwaldvogel.de/ <br/>.
<br/>
When the dataset becomes larger, liblinear is also very fast .
